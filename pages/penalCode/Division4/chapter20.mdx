## 212. Killing unborn child.
Any person who, when a woman is about to be delivered of a child, prevents

## 213. Infanticide.
Where a woman by any wilful act or omission causes the death of her child
being a child under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or
omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having
fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the
effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then,
notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for the provisions
of this section the offence would have amounted to murder, she commits the
felony of infanticide, and may for such offence be dealt with and punished
as if she had been guilty of the offence of manslaughter of the child.
