### CHAPTER 18

# MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER.

## 187. Manslaughter.
(1) Any person who by an unlawful act or omission causes the death
of another person commits the felony termed manslaughter.
(2) An unlawful omission is an omission amounting to culpable
negligence to discharge a duty tending to the preservation of life or health,
whether such omission is or is not accompanied by an intention to cause
death or bodily harm.

## 188. Murder.
Any person who of malice aforethought causes the death of another person
by an unlawful act or omission commits murder.

## 189. Punishment of murder.
Any person convicted of murder shall be sentenced to death.

## 190. Punishment of manslaughter.
Any person who commits the felony of manslaughter is liable to
imprisonment for life.

## 191. Malice aforethought.
Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence providing
either of the following circumstances—

(a) an intention to cause the death of any person, whether such
person is the person actually killed or not; or

(b) knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably
cause the death of some person, whether such person is the
person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is
accompanied by indifference whether death is caused or not, or
by a wish that it may not be caused.

## 192. Killing on provocation.
When a person who unlawfully kills another under circumstances which, but
for this section, would constitute murder, does the act which causes death in
the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation as defined in section 193,
and before there is time for his or her passion to cool, he or she commits
manslaughter only.

## 193. Provocation defined.
(1) “Provocation” means and includes, except as stated in subsections
(3) to (5), any wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be likely—
(a) when done or offered to an ordinary person; or
(b) when done or offered in the presence of an ordinary person to
another person—
(i) who is under his or her immediate care; or
(ii) to whom he or she stands in a conjugal, parental, filial or
fraternal relation, or in the relation of master and servant,
to deprive him or her of the power of self-control and to induce him or her
to commit an assault of the kind which the person charged committed upon
the person by whom the act or insult is done or offered.
(2) When such an act or insult is done or offered by one person—
(a) to another; or
(b) in the presence of another to a person—
(i) who is under the immediate care of that other; or
(ii) to whom that other stands in any such relation as aforesaid,
the former is said to give to that other provocation for an assault.
(3) A lawful act is not provocation to any person for an assault.
(4) An act which a person does in consequence of incitement given
by another person in order to induce him or her to do the act and thereby to
furnish an excuse for committing an assault is not provocation to that other
person for an assault.
(5) An arrest which is unlawful is not necessarily provocation for an
assault, but it may be evidence of provocation to a person who knows of the
illegality.

## 194. Diminished responsibility.
(1) Where a person is found guilty of the murder or of being a party
to the murder of another, and the court is satisfied that he or she was
suffering from such abnormality of mind, whether arising from a condition
of arrested or retarded development of mind, or any inherent causes or
induced by disease or injury, as substantially impaired his or her mental
responsibility for his or her acts and omissions in doing or being a party to
the murder, the court shall make a special finding to the effect that the
accused was guilty of murder but with diminished responsibility.

(2) On a charge of murder, it shall be for the defence to prove that the
person charged was suffering from such abnormality of mind as is mentioned
in subsection (1).

(3) Where a special finding is made under subsection (1), the court
shall not sentence the person convicted to death but shall order him or her to
be detained in safe custody; and section 105 of the Trial on Indictments Act
shall apply as if the order had been made under that section.

(4) The fact that one party to a murder is by virtue of this section not
liable to be sentenced to death shall not affect the question whether any other
party to it shall be sentenced to death.

## 195. Suicide pacts.
(1) It shall be manslaughter and shall not be murder for a person
acting in pursuance of a suicide pact between him or her and another to kill
the other or be a party to the other killing himself or herself or being killed
by a third person.

(2) Where it is shown that a person charged with the murder of
another killed the other or was a party to the other’s killing himself or herself
or being killed, it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged
was acting in pursuance of a suicide pact between him or her and the other.

(3) For the purposes of this section, “suicide pact” means a common
agreement between two or more persons having for its object the death of all
of them, whether or not each is to take his or her own life, but nothing done
by a person who enters into a suicide pact shall be treated as done by him or
her in pursuance of the pact unless it is done while he or she has the settled
intention of dying in pursuance of the pact.

## 196. Causing death defined.
A person is deemed to have caused the death of another person although his
or her act is not the immediate or sole cause of death in any of the following
cases—

(a) if he or she inflicts bodily injury on another person in
consequence of which that person undergoes surgical or medical
treatment which causes death. In this case it is immaterial
whether the treatment was proper or mistaken, if it was employed
in good faith and with common knowledge and skill; but the
person inflicting the injury is not deemed to have caused the
death if the treatment which was its immediate cause was not
employed in good faith or was so employed without common
knowledge or skill;

(b) if he or she inflicts a bodily injury on another which would not
have caused death if the injured person had submitted to proper
surgical or medical treatment or had observed proper precautions
as to his or her mode of living;

(c) if by actual or threatened violence he or she causes such other
person to perform an act which causes the death of such person,
such act being a means of avoiding such violence which in the
circumstances would appear natural to the person whose death is
so caused;

(d) if by any act or omission he or she hastened the death of a person
suffering under any disease or injury which apart from such act
or omission would have caused death;

(e) if his or her act or omission would not have caused death unless
it had been accompanied by an act or omission of the person
killed or of other persons.

## 197. When child deemed a person.
A child becomes a person capable of being killed when it has completely
proceeded in a living state from the body of its mother, whether it has
breathed or not, and whether it has an independent circulation or not, and
whether the navel string is severed or not.

## 198. Limitation as to time of death.
(1) A person is not deemed to have killed another if the death of that
person does not take place within a year and a day of the cause of death.

(2) Such period is reckoned inclusive of the day on which the last
unlawful act contributing to the cause of death was done, and when the cause
of death is an omission to observe or perform a duty, the period is reckoned
inclusive of the day on which the omission ceased.

(3) When the cause of death is in part an unlawful act and in part an
omission to observe or perform a duty, the period is reckoned inclusive of the
day on which the last unlawful act was done or the day on which the
omission ceased, whichever is the later
