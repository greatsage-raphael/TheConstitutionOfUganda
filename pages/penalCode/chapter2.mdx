### CHAPTER 2

# TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THE CODE.

## 4. Extent of jurisdiction of courts.
(1) The jurisdiction of the courts of Uganda for the purposes of this
Code extends to every place within Uganda.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the courts of Uganda shall have
jurisdiction to try offences created under sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28
committed outside Uganda by a Uganda citizen or person ordinarily resident
in Uganda.

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, the offences referred to in subsection
(2) committed outside Uganda by a Ugandan citizen or a person ordinarily
resident in Uganda shall be dealt with as if they had been committed in
Uganda.

## 5. Offences committed partly within and partly beyond the jurisdiction.
When an act which, if wholly done within the jurisdiction of the court, would
be an offence against this Code is done partly within and partly beyond the
jurisdiction, every person who within the jurisdiction does or makes any part
of such act may be tried and punished under this Code in the same manner
as if such act had been done wholly within the jurisdiction
