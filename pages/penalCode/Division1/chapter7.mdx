in the case of the defamation of a private person, publishes anything intended
to be read, or any sign or visible representation, tending to degrade, revile or
expose to hatred or contempt any foreign prince, potentate, ambassador or
other foreign dignitary with intent to disturb peace and friendship between

equipping such vessel, and furnishes such particulars of the
contract and of any matters relating to, or done, or to be
done under the contract as may be required by the Minister;
and

(ii) he or she gives such security, and takes and permits to be
