have been feloniously stolen, taken, extorted, obtained or disposed of,
commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

(2) Any person who receives or retains any chattel, money, valuable
security or other property, knowing or having reason to believe the same to
have been unlawfully taken, obtained, converted or disposed of in a manner
which constitutes a misdemeanour, commits a misdemeanour and is liable to
the same punishment as the offender by whom the property was unlawfully
obtained, converted or disposed of.

(3) No person, except a person pleading guilty, shall be convicted of
an offence under this section unless it shall first be proved that the property
which is the subject matter of the charge has in fact been stolen or
feloniously or unlawfully taken, extorted, obtained, converted or disposed of.

(4) Whenever any person is being proceeded against under any of the
provisions of this section for receiving or retaining any property, for the
purpose of proving guilty knowledge there may be given in evidence at any
stage of the proceedings—

months preceding the date of the offence charged was found or
had been in his or her possession;

(b) the fact that within the five years preceding the date of the
offence charged he or she was convicted of any offence involving
fraud or dishonesty; but this fact may not be proved unless—

(i) seven days’ notice in writing has been given to the offender
that proof of such previous conviction is intended to be
given; and

(ii) evidence has been given that the property in respect of
which the offender is being tried was found or had been in
his or her possession, and
no evidence of the kind mentioned in this subsection may be given in any
proceedings if there is included in the charge or indictment a count for any
offence other than an offence under the provisions of this section.
