## 254. Definition of theft.
(1) A person who fraudulently and without claim of right takes
anything capable of being stolen, or fraudulently converts to the use of any
person other than the general or special owner thereof anything capable of
being stolen, is said to steal that thing.

(2) A person who takes or converts anything capable of being stolen
is deemed to do so fraudulently if he or she does so with any of the following
intents—

(a) an intent permanently to deprive the general or special owner of
the thing of it;

(b) an intent to use the thing as a pledge or security;

(c) an intent to part with it on a condition as to its return which the
person taking or converting it may be unable to perform;

(d) an intent to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be
returned in the condition in which it was at the time of the taking
or conversion;

(e) in the case of money, an intent to use it at the will of the person
who takes or converts it, although he or she may intend
afterwards to repay the amount to the owner,
and “special owner” includes any person who has any charge or lien upon the
thing in question or any right arising from or dependent upon holding
possession of the thing in question.

(3) A person shall be taken to use money at his or her own will for
the purposes of subsection (2)(e), if that person deliberately or recklessly
exceeds the limits of authority allowed to him or her, or deliberately or
recklessly disregards any rules of procedure, prescribed by the owner in
respect of the money.

a power of attorney for the disposition of it, or is otherwise
authorised to dispose of it.

(5) When a thing converted has been lost by the owner and found by
the person who converts it, the conversion is not deemed to be fraudulent if
at the time of the conversion the person taking or converting the thing does
not know who is the owner and believes on reasonable grounds that the
owner cannot be discovered.

(6) A person shall not be deemed to take a thing unless he or she
moves the thing or causes it to move.

her from his or her principal at the time of pledging or giving the lien,
together with the amount of any bill of exchange or promissory note accepted
or made by him or her for or on account of his or her principal, such dealing
with the goods or document of title is not deemed to be theft.

belonging to or in the possession of his or her master, that taking is not
deemed to be theft.

received in exchange for it, are deemed to be the property of the person from
whom the property was so received, until they have been disposed of in
accordance with the terms on which the property was received, unless it is a
part of those terms that the proceeds, if any, shall form an item in a debtor
and creditor account between him or her and the person to whom he or she
