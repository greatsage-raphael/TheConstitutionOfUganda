### Chapter 17

#DEFAMATION.

## 179. Definition of libel.
Any person who, by print, writing, painting, effigy or by any means
otherwise than solely by gestures, spoken words or other sounds, unlawfully
publishes any defamatory matter concerning another person, with intent to
defame that other person, commits the misdemeanour termed libel.

## 180. Definition of defamatory matter.
(1) Defamatory matter is matter likely to injure the reputation of any
person by exposing that person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or likely to
damage any person in his or her profession or trade by an injury to his or her
reputation.

(2) It is immaterial whether at the time of the publication of the
defamatory matter the person concerning whom such matter is published is
living or dead.

(3) No prosecution for the publication of defamatory matter
concerning a dead person shall be instituted without the consent of the
Director of Public Prosecutions.

## 181. Definition of publication.
(1) A person publishes a libel if he causes the print, writing, painting,
effigy or other means by which the defamatory matter is conveyed to be so
dealt with, either by exhibition, reading, recitation, description, delivery or
otherwise, that the defamatory meaning thereof becomes known or is likely
to become known to either the person defamed or any other person.

(2) It is not necessary for libel that a defamatory meaning should be
directly or completely expressed, and it suffices if such meaning and its
application to the person alleged to be defamed can be collected either from
the alleged libel itself or from any extrinsic circumstances or partly by the
one and partly by the other means.

## 182. Definition of unlawful publication.
Any publication of defamatory matter concerning a person is unlawful within
the meaning of this Chapter, unless—

(a) the matter is true and it was for the public benefit that it should
be published; or

(b) it is privileged on one of the grounds mentioned in this Chapter.

## 183. Absolute privilege of defamatory matter.
(1) The publication of defamatory matter is absolutely privileged, and
no person shall in any circumstances be liable to punishment under this Code
in respect of such publication, in any of the following cases—
(a) if the matter is published by the President, the Government or
Parliament; 

(b) if the matter is published in Parliament by the Government or by
any member of that Parliament or by the Speaker; 

(c) if the matter is published by order of the President or the
Government; 

(d) if the matter is published concerning a person subject to military,
naval or air force discipline for the time being, and relates to his
or her conduct as a person subject to such discipline, and is
published by some person having authority over him or her in
respect of such conduct, and to some person having authority
over him or her in respect of such conduct; 

(e) if the matter is published in the course of any judicial
proceedings by a person taking part in them as a judge,
magistrate, commissioner, advocate, assessor, juror, witness or
party to the proceedings; 

(f) if the matter published is in fact a fair report of anything said,
done or published in Parliament; or

(g) if the person publishing the matter is legally bound to publish it.

(2) Where a publication is absolutely privileged, it is immaterial for
the purposes of this Chapter whether the matter is true or false, and whether
it is or is not known or believed to be false and whether it is or is not
published in good faith; but nothing in this section shall exempt a person
from any liability to punishment under any other Chapter of this Code or
under any other written law in force in Uganda.

## 184. Conditional privilege of defamatory matter.
The publication of defamatory matter is privileged if it is published in good
faith and—

(a) if the relation between the parties by and to whom the publication
is made is such that the person publishing the matter is under
some legal, moral or social duty to publish it to the person to
whom the publication is made or has a legitimate personal
interest in so publishing it; 

(b) if the matter published is in fact a fair report of anything said,
done or shown in a civil or criminal inquiry or proceeding before
any court; except that if the court prohibits the publication of
anything said or shown before it, on the ground that it is
seditious, immoral or blasphemous, the publication thereof shall
not be privileged; 

(c) if the matter published is a copy or reproduction, or in fact a fair
abstract, of any matter which has been previously published, and
the previous publication of which was or would have been
privileged under section 183; 

(d) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the
conduct of a person in a judicial, official or other public capacity
or as to his or her personal character so far as it appears in such
conduct;

(e) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the
conduct of a person in relation to any public question or matter,
or as to his or her personal character so far as it appears in such
conduct;

(f) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the
conduct of any person as disclosed by evidence given in a public
legal proceeding, whether civil or criminal, or as to the conduct
of any person as a party, witness or otherwise in any such
proceeding or as to the character of any person so far as it
appears in any such conduct as mentioned in this paragraph;

(g) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the
merits of any book, writing, painting, speech or other work,
performance or act published or publicly done or made, or
submitted by a person to the judgment of the public or as to the
character of the person so far as it appears therein; 

(h) if the matter is a censure passed by a person in good faith on the
conduct of another person in any matter in respect of which he or
she has authority, by contract or otherwise, over the other person
or on the character of the other person, so far as it appears in such
conduct; 

(i) if the matter is a complaint or accusation made by a person in
good faith against another person in respect of his or her conduct
in any matter, or in respect of his or her character so far as it
appears in such conduct, to any person having authority, by
contract or otherwise, over that other person in respect of such
conduct or matter, or having authority by law to inquire into or
receive complaints respecting such conduct or matter; or

(j) if the matter is published in good faith for the protection of the
rights or interests of the person who publishes it or of the person
to whom it is published, or of some person in whom the person
to whom it is published is interested.

## 185. Good faith defined.
A publication of defamatory matter shall not be deemed to have been made
in good faith by a person, within the meaning of section 184, if it is made to
appear either—

(a) that the matter was untrue and that he or she did not believe it to
be true;

(b) that the matter was untrue and that he or she published it without
having taken reasonable care to ascertain whether it was true or
false; or 

(c) that in publishing the matter, he or she acted with intent to injure
the person defamed in a substantially greater degree or
substantially otherwise than was reasonably necessary for the
interest of the public or for the protection of the private right or
interest in respect of which he or she claims to be privileged.

## 186. Presumption as to good faith.
If it is proved on behalf of the accused person that the defamatory matter was
published under such circumstances that the publication would have been
justified if made in good faith, the publication shall be presumed to have
been made in good faith until the contrary is made to appear, either from the
libel itself, or from the evidence given on behalf of the accused person or
from evidence given on the part of the prosecution.
