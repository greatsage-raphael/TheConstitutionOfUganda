service.
Any person employed in the public service who, in the discharge of the

if committed against a private person, commits a misdemeanour.

## 114. Neglect of duty.
(1) A person who, being employed in a public body or a company in
which the Government has shares, neglects to perform any duty which he or
she is required to perform by virtue of such employment, commits an offence
and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five
years.

(2) It shall be a defence to a charge under subsection (1) that the
discharge of the duty in question was impeded by reasonable cause.

## 115. False information.
Whoever gives to any person employed in the public service any information
which he or she knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or
knowing it to be likely that he or she will thereby cause, any person

(a) to do or omit anything which the person employed in the public
service ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting
which such information is given were known to him or her;

Any person who wilfully disobeys any written law by doing any act which
it forbids, or by omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, and

of the legislature to provide some other penalty for such disobedience, to
imprisonment for two years.

## 117. Disobedience of lawful orders.
Any person who disobeys any order, warrant or command duly made, issued

of such disobedience, to imprisonment for two years
