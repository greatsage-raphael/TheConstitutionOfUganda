### CHAPTER 3

# GENERAL RULES AS TO CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY.

## 6. Ignorance of law.
Ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for any act or omission
which would otherwise constitute an offence unless knowledge of the law by
the offender is expressly declared to be an element of the offence.

## 7. Claim of right.
A person is not criminally responsible in respect of an offence relating to
property if the act done or omitted to be done by the person with respect to
the property was done in the exercise of an honest claim of right and without
intention to defraud.

## 8. Intention and motive.
(1) Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to
negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for an act
or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his or her will or
for an event which occurs by accident.

(2) Unless the intention to cause a particular result is expressly
declared to be an element of the offence constituted, in whole or in part, by
an act or omission, the result intended to be caused by an act or omission is
immaterial.

(3) Unless otherwise expressly declared, the motive by which a
person is induced to do or omit to do an act, or to form an intention, is
immaterial so far as regards criminal responsibility.

## 9. Mistake of fact.
(1) A person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and
reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of things is not
criminally responsible for the act or omission to any greater extent than if the
real state of things had been such as he or she believed to exist.

(2) The operation of this section may be excluded by the express or
implied provisions of the law relating to the subject.

## 10. Presumption of sanity.
Every person is presumed to be of sound mind, and to have been of sound
mind at any time which comes in question, until the contrary is proved.

## 11. Insanity.
A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if at the time of
doing the act or making the omission he or she is through any disease
affecting his or her mind incapable of understanding what he or she is doing
or of knowing that he or she ought not to do the act or make the omission; but
a person may be criminally responsible for an act or omission, although his
or her mind is affected by disease, if that disease does not in fact produce
upon his or her mind one or other of the effects mentioned in this section in
reference to that act or omission.

## 12. Intoxication.
(1) Except as provided in this section, intoxication shall not constitute
a defence to any criminal charge.

(2) Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason
of the intoxication the person charged at the time of the act or omission
complained of did not know that the act or omission was wrong or did not
know what he or she was doing and—

(a) the state of intoxication was caused without his or her consent by
the malicious or negligent act of another person; or

(b) the person charged was by reason of intoxication insane,
temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission.

(3) Where the defence under subsection (2) is established, then in a
case falling under subsection (2)(a) the accused person shall be discharged;
and in a case falling under subsection (2)(b), the provisions of the
Magistrates Court Act relating to insanity shall apply.

(4) Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific
or otherwise, in the absence of which he or she would not be guilty of the
offence.

(5) For the purposes of this section, “intoxication” shall be deemed
to include a state produced by narcotics or drugs.

## 13. Judicial officers.
Except as expressly provided by this Code, a judicial officer is not criminally
responsible for anything done or omitted to be done by him or her in the
exercise of his or her judicial functions, although the act done is in excess of
his or her judicial authority or although he or she is bound to do the act
omitted to be done.

## 14. Compulsion.
A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if it is committed by
two or more offenders and if the act is done or omitted only because during
the whole of the time in which it is being done or omitted the person is
compelled to do or omit to do the act by threats on the part of the other
offender or offenders instantly to kill him or her or do him or her grievous
bodily harm if he or she refuses; but threats of future injury do not excuse
any offence.

## 15. Defence of person or property and rash, reckless and negligent acts.
Subject to any express provisions in this Code or any other law in force in
Uganda, criminal responsibility—
(a) for the use of force in the defence of person and property; and
(b) in respect of rash, reckless or negligent acts, shall be determined according to the principles of English law.

## 16. Use of force in effecting arrest.
Where any person is charged with a criminal offence arising out of the arrest,
or attempted arrest, by him or her of a person who forcibly resists the arrest
or attempts to evade being arrested, the court shall, in considering whether
the means used were necessary, or the degree of force used was reasonable,
for the apprehension of that person, have regard to the gravity of the offence
which had been or was being committed by the person and the circumstances
in which the offence had been or was being committed by the person.

## 17. Compulsion by husband.
A married woman is not free from criminal responsibility for doing or
omitting to do an act merely because the act or omission takes place in the
presence of her husband; but on a charge against a wife for any offence other
than treason or murder, it shall be a good defence to prove that the offence
was committed in the presence of, and under the coercion of, the husband.

## 18. Person not to be punished twice for same offence.
A person shall not be punished twice either under this Code or under any
other law for the same offence.
